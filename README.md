# Lyrics-Scrapper
This is simple Lyrics scrapping Tool using Selenium with Python.
Here, I have used 'Musixmatch' website for scrapping lyrics of the song we need.
WebDriver is imported, and the ChromeDriver path is given to it.
The program then gets the song name as input from the user, then the song is searched by selenium's automation, by using the Chrome browser.
The XPath of the element, where the lyrics is present, is converted as text and displayed to the user.
If the element is not found, the program asks the user for some other song.
